# Part 2 - Reflection
**Q:** In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned! \

**A:** From my lab experience in the second half of this quarter, I learned how to think about problems in another way from my lab partners. We would share our way of thinking and logic as we were working together. I also learned how to use commands in the terminal, bash sh, grep, echo, and cloning. The Q&A with the TAs was helpful during the end of lab.
